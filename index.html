                <p>Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of
                    us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes
                    into
                    making a website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to
                    master the
                    art of front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
                </p>

                <p>However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end
                    design and
                    web development.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style">Commenting</h4>
                        <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes
                            that are
                            written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project
                            you
                            create.
                            With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and
                            understand
                            where things are at and how they work.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style">Invest In Productive Tools.</h4>
                        <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart
                            plugins,
                            the
                            amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web
                            tools
                            that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery,
                            Emmet,
                            Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style">Always Be Curious.</h4>
                        <p>A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news
                            and
                            innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about
                            front-end
                            development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative
                            and useful
                            learning sources for front-end developers -</p>
                        <ul type="circle" class="sources">
                            <li><a href="https://frontendfoc.us/" target="_blank">Frontend Focus</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://css-weekly.com/" target="_blank">CSS Weekly</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/" target="_blank">Javascript Weekly</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://web-design-weekly.com/" target="_blank">Web Design Weekly</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/" target="_blank">Codrops</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/" target="_blank">ShopTalk Podcast</a></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Also, make it a point to attend conferences and webinars. These meet-ups provide excellent
                            opportunities to expand your network and get acquainted with talented people.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style">Refactor Your Code From Time to Time</h4>
                        <p>The basic purpose of code refactoring is to make the code more efficient and maintainable.
                            This is
                            key in reducing technical cost since it’s much better to clean up the code now than pay for
                            costly
                            errors later. Code refactoring, which improves readability, makes the QA and debugging
                            process go
                            much more smoothly. And while it doesn’t remove bugs, it can certainly help prevent them in
                            the
                            future.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <h4 class="h-style"> Automate! </h4>
                        <p>
                            As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can
                            get overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing,
                            workflow, dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on.
                            Doesn’t sound easy, right?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation
                            can take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas
                            of front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the
                            user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you
                            will also learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall
                            functionality of your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation
                            tools.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must
                    always remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget
                    to create your signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end
                    development.
